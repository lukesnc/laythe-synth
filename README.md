## Features

Layhte uses a simple UI to control paramaters such as enabling/disabling oscillators, selecting wavetables, changing oscillator volume, and more. Layhte can be controlled with a USB MIDI controller or your computer's keyboard (by passing the `--keyboard` option).

### Recording

Laythe can toggle recording the current session by pressing R or pressing the red recording button. Files are saved in WAV format to `recordings/` in this directory.
